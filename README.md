# TheKingElessar's Printer Profiles

I've got an [Ender 3](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.all3dp.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F09%2F26132106%2Fender-3-deal.jpg&f=1&nofb=1) 3D printer. I use [Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura) to slice my files and prepare them for printingâ€”these are the profiles I use.

## Profiles

### [PETGThinwallCura4.4.curaprofile](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/3D-Printer-Profiles/blob/master/PETGThinwallCura4.4.curaprofile)

I'm working on printing the [36" Northern Pike RC Airplane](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3040294) for a friend. I'm using [eSun PETG filament](https://www.amazon.com/eSUN-Filament-Printer-Diameter-Semi-transparent/dp/B010TWUQJ8/), so this profile is especially for PETG parts. This profile is **exactly the same** as the profile provided by the creator [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/download:7558638), but updated for modern Cura versions. The only change I would suggest is disabling `Retract at Layer Change`. When I had it on it added lots of gaps in my prints. 

### [36'' Northern Pike RC Airplane.curaprofile](https://github.com/TheKingElessar/3D-Printer-Profiles/blob/master/36''%20Northern%20Pike%20RC%20Airplane.curaprofile)

This is my version of the above PETG thin-wall profile. It mostly has modifications with the retraction settings.

## Misc.
Check out [this huge list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfVFPHdT8-bG0KmCqh5enULdWXQxZ2HHscNTdA0m4vc/edit) of Ender 3 parts, upgrades, and tips I've compiled! It should be immensly useful to anyone who's just starting with an Ender 3 printer.
